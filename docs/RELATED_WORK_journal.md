\subsection*{Telemetry and Performance Monitoring in Motorcycle Racing}

Existing motorcycle telemetry systems---such as Magneti Marelli's data acquisition platforms, MotoGP's homologated systems, and commercial offerings like 2D Datarecording---represent the current state-of-the-art in performance monitoring. However, these systems are fundamentally \textit{passive} and \textit{post-mortem} in nature, collecting high-frequency kinematic, thermodynamic, and operational data that is analyzed \textit{after} the riding session concludes, typically through offline visualization tools and retrospective coaching sessions \cite{magneti_2023}. While invaluable for post-hoc analysis, these systems cannot provide real-time intervention during performance, and critically, they treat the rider as an externality to the control system rather than an integrated component. The coaching feedback remains decoupled from the actual decision-making loop: a coach reviews recorded telemetry and suggests corrections for the next lap, but the rider's physiological state during that original lap---their stress level, cognitive load, or attentional bandwidth---remains invisible to the analysis. This represents a fundamental gap in performance optimization. Our approach inverts this paradigm by making biometric state central to the real-time control architecture, enabling instantaneous adaptation based on the rider's current physiological condition rather than retrospective analysis of past performance.

\subsection*{Haptic Feedback and Wearable Coaching Systems}

Prior work on haptic feedback in sports coaching has explored vest-based systems (e.g., directional cueing in skiing), force-feedback steering wheels in racing simulators, and wrist-worn vibration patterns for posture correction in gymnastics and rowing \cite{sigrist_2013_haptic, cirstea_2019_haptic_vests, yagou_2021_vibrotactile}. These systems universally employ \textit{rule-based feedback policies}, where haptic stimulation is triggered by simple conditional logic: ``if current speed exceeds threshold $X$, vibrate with pattern $Y$.'' The underlying assumption is that a fixed mapping between environmental state and haptic response can effectively guide behavior. However, this approach ignores a critical dimension: the rider's \textit{cognitive and physiological context}. A rider experiencing high stress and cognitive overload responds differently to identical haptic cues compared to a relaxed rider in optimal arousal state. Static rules fail to account for individual differences in stress susceptibility, attention capacity, or the interaction between current workload and haptic processing capability. Furthermore, none of these prior systems model the bidirectional relationship between cognitive load and learning effectiveness (Cognitive Load Theory), nor do they close the feedback loop through a learning agent capable of adapting the coaching strategy itself. Haptic feedback, in existing implementations, remains a reactive output layer disconnected from an adaptive control architecture.

\subsection*{The Missing Link: Bio-Cybernetic Adaptive Coaching}

To our knowledge, no prior work has integrated real-time physiological state (specifically, heart-rate variability measured via RMSSD, a validated biomarker of autonomic balance and cognitive load) directly into the decision-making loop of a reinforcement learning agent operating within a Gymnasium-compatible motorcycle environment. The critical innovation of this work lies in the \textit{Bio-Cybernetic Loop}: a closed-loop control system where (1) biometric measurements from the rider inform the state representation of a Markov decision process, (2) a policy-gradient agent learns to optimize coaching actions (including haptic modulation) conditioned on this augmented biometric state, and (3) a non-learnable gating mechanism enforces safety by blocking all coaching actions when stress exceeds critical thresholds, ensuring that physiological safety is guaranteed by design rather than by learning. This is formalized through a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) where the rider's hidden state includes not only kinematic variables (position, velocity, lean angle) but also the physiological variables that determine cognitive capacity. Critically, we operationalize Cognitive Load Theory---the principle that learning and performance are mediated by available working memory and attentional resources---by making RMSSD an explicit component of the reward function, with a piecewise structure that penalizes decisions leading to extreme stress (RMSSD $<10$ ms, indicating panic state) and rewards actions maintaining parasympathetic balance (RMSSD $>50$ ms). The bio-supervisor gating mechanism ($a_{\text{final}} = a_{\text{RL}} \cdot \mathbb{I}(\text{RMSSD} > \theta_{\text{gate}})$) operates as a hard constraint implemented in firmware, guaranteeing that no learned policy can override physiological safety thresholds, a property absent from all prior haptic coaching systems. By grounding this system in NeuroKit2, a validated psychophysiological signal processing library, we ensure that RMSSD computation follows gold-standard methodologies from the HPA (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal) axis literature. This represents the first application of integrated bio-cybernetic control to real-time motorcycle coaching, fundamentally bridging the gap between passive telemetry, rule-based haptics, and adaptive reinforcement learning through the unified framework of biometric-aware Markov decision processes.
